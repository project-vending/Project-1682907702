#  Data lake architecture using AWS S3, Python, and Airflow: In this project, you will build a data lake architecture using AWS S3 as the storage layer, Python for data processing, and Airflow for workflow management. The data pipeline will involve ingesting data from various sources, transforming and cleaning it using Python, and storing it in the data lake on AWS S3. Airflow can be used to schedule and monitor the pipeline for any issues.
